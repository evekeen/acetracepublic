any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or information, whether oral or written,

suppliers and employees be liable for</p>
<ul>
<li>any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other

strict liability, or any other basis, even if company has been advised of the possibility of such damage.</p>
