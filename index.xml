      <description>F.A.Q. How do I add a line? Free Curve - manual In manual mode you can mark a few points, and the app will create a smooth line using then.
Scroll the video to find the object Select the object by moving the cursor. You can zoom-in with 2 fingers Scroll the video again and mark the object by moving the cursor Add 4 to 10 key points through the flight Tap Preview to preview the result Disc Golf - automatic Scroll to the beginning of the flight Select a disc by the rectangular frame Tap the Start Tracking button Golf Scroll the video to find the start of the flight Select the ball by moving the cursor Adjust the landing point by moving the yellow ring Adjust the shape of the trajectory by moving control points Change the flight duration by resizing the bar in the timeline Adjust the acceleration - make the opaque line end match the current frame ball position Can Ace Trace do it automatically?</description>

      <description>Congratulations, you found me! Let&amp;rsquo;s create awesome highlights You can put your phone in the holder, and use me for filing your throw. Upload your video and we&amp;rsquo;ll add a line folling your disc to it.
Can you match the line? You have a chance to compete with other disc golfers, trying to repeat a shot made by a pro. We will put your and the reference line in the same video, so you&amp;rsquo;ll see the double ace trace line for yourself!</description>
