<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></em></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>
<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</p>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>
<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

<p><strong>Other Users.</strong> When you share personal information (for example, by posting comments, contributions, or other content to the Services) or otherwise interact with public areas of the Services, such personal information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the Services in perpetuity. If you interact with other users of our Services and register for our Services through a social network (such as Facebook), your contacts on the social network will see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Services, and view your profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Offer Wall.</strong> Our application(s) may display a third-party hosted &ldquo;offer wall.&rdquo; Such an offer wall allows third-party advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for the acceptance and completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in our application(s) and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging to other persons and will leave our application(s). A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.</p>

<h2 id="5-how-do-we-handle-your-social-logins">5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>
<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

<h2 id="6-how-long-do-we-keep-your-information">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p><a name="infosafe"></a></p>
<h2 id="7-how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws.

<h2 id="10-controls-for-do-not-track-features">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

<p>Verification process</p>
<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system.

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
